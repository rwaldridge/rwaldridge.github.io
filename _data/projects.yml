  short_description: "Leading the global application of advanced AI and federated analytics to create billions of estimates for over 300 diseases"
  long_description: |
    As Team Lead for Clinical Informatics at IHME, this project that I lead drives the application 
    of federated data analytics and advanced AI methods to 60 electronic health record 
    sources. We pioneer AI methods, including novel Kernel Regression (Kreg) models 
    utilizing sparse linear algebra, to predict hospital admission rates 
    across 204 countries.

  short_description: "Creating reproducible AI pipelines for disease phenotyping using NLP and LLMs across multilingual systems"
  long_description: |
    This project exploits AI phenotyping by combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
    with Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to create a reproducible AI pipeline 
    for disease phenotyping across multilingual medical classification systems, a critical 
    innovation as global electronic health record access expands.

  long_description: |
    Rapid mobilization of research infrastructure during the COVID-19 pandemic to establish 
    a cohort of 60,000 people across England and Wales. The study collected over 1 billion 
    data points to examine antibody waning, vaccine effectiveness, and health inequities 
    faced by racial and ethnic minority groups.

  short_description: "Analyzing healthcare utilization gaps and vaccination delays among migrant populations and refugees"
  long_description: |
    Using a newly created national linked electronic health record dataset, this project 
    demonstrated that migrants were less likely to use primary care than UK-born individuals, 
    a gap that widened during the pandemic. We also undertook the first large-scale analysis 
    showing substantial delays in refugees receiving second and booster vaccination doses.

  short_description: "Establishing the field of inclusion health by quantifying mortality risks in socially excluded groups"
  long_description: |
    Collated global data to demonstrate extreme health inequities in socially excluded 
    populations. This evidence informed global interventions by the WHO and the UK 
    Department of Health's Rough Sleeping Strategy. We established that nearly one in 
    three deaths among people experiencing homelessness admitted to hospital were preventable.
