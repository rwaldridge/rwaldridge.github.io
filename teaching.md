## Postgraduate Teaching

### 2023 - Present: Health Metrics Science 592, UW

I lead a Health Metrics Science (HMS) seminar course that is designed to strengthen students' ability to critically assess, examine, and interpret research articles and seeks to broaden students' understanding and knowledge about the field of health metrics sciences. The course is highly interdisciplinary in nature, bringing together notions, methods, and techniques; this course specifically intends to integrate these diverse aspects of the field.


### 2018 - 2023: Public Health Data Science (Module Lead), UCL

I led the development of this new MSc module which ran for the first time in 2019. This module sits within the **MSc in Health Data Science** and introduces students to tools and methods used in data science (including computer science, mathematics, statistics) and public health. This combination of skills allows students to explore new and emerging data sources, provides them with training in how to think critically about these data and apply core public health skills of leadership and advocacy to use these new insights to improve the health of the public. In creating this module I led my research group in designing, creating and delivering all student material including course aims and objectives, lecture slides and notes, supplementary material, computer-based practical exercises and their solutions, and datasets for students to explore.

### 2011 - 2018: Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Global Health Policy (Module Lead), UCL

This module is offered to students across a range of MSc courses and sits within the MSc in Global Health Policy based at the Institute of Global Health. The module introduces students to key scientific concepts within the field of infectious disease epidemiology and has a practical focus on how these concepts inform evidence-based global health policy. The course covers core concepts, including factors influencing transmission dynamics, vaccine epidemiology, basic molecular epidemiology and the impact of underlying structural and political influences on policy development and implementation. I set up this course in 2011 with Dr Nigel Field and created course aims and objectives, lecture slides and notes, supplementary material, practical exercises and their solutions.

### 2017 - 2023: Homeless and Inclusion Health, UCL

This is a dynamic new module for practitioners working with homeless and other excluded populations and was developed and delivered by the Faculty for Homeless and Inclusion Health (affiliated to Pathway) and UCL's Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care. The course offers an opportunity for those with an interest in excluded or hard-to-reach groups the chance to learn from world-class UCL researchers, experienced policy makers and service providers, and former/current members of these communities. As a result of my experience in quantitative methodologies in Inclusion Health I was asked to create and deliver an interactive teaching session in Applied Quantitative and Qualitative Research Methods, as well as providing input into the wider design and development of the course.

### 2015 - 2023: Principles of Epidemiology Applied to Electronic Health Records Research (Session Lead), UCL

The module provides core epidemiological skills enabling students to interpret electronic health records (EHR) research and design analyses using EHRs. I was part of a team that developed this new MSc module at IHI and in this role I **mentored several members of staff** in the development and delivery of their content for the course as well as delivering several lectures myself on designing research questions and undertaking trial using EHRs.

## Undergraduate Teaching

### 2011 - 2017: The Population Perspective (Module Lead), UCL

I redesigned and led this core module on the iBSc in primary care and population health (2011-2017). This course enables students to understand the health needs of a population, how these may be assessed and the role of primary care services in meeting these needs. The themes include principles of epidemiology, assessing the health needs of a population, preventing disease, promoting health, evaluating health care delivery and allocation of resources.
